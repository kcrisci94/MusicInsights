# We need to use Tidyverse for data import and manipulation
# If uninstalled, install with 'install.packages("tidyverse")'
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Load in data
```{r}
survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")
```

# Cleaned up column Names
# Better to not use column number, because data can change and # future users inadvertently rename the wrong column
```{r}

colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Which musical instruments/talents do you play? (Select all that apply)"] <- "Musical Instruments Played"
